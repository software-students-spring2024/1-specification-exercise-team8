## Stakeholders

Katherine Han is a NYU student that is a frequent party-goer who is also a DJ at parties. She fits into this demographic as she struggles to find ways to organize requested songs at parties. As mentioned in her interview, she would like to seek ways to efficiently manage music suggestions while engaging the preferences of the crowd. 

Goals / Needs: 
- Need a portable/easy way to let the DJ know which songs to play without having to physically go up to the booth.
- Need an organized system where only the songs that fit into the assigned theme (by the host) can be requested.
- Need to ensure that the songs can be downloaded and played seamlessly on set.
- Would like to gauge/understand the preference of the audiences/crowd in real time.

Problems / Frustrations:
- Find it difficult to gauge the “vibe” of the crowd when DJ-ing/hosting at a new place.
- Traditional way (direct interaction with the DJ) could be overwhelming and chaotic as there are too many requests all at once.
- Sometimes there are too many songs requested that don’t match the theme of the party/event.
- Some people in the crowd find it intimidating to request songs so their preferences are often ignored.

## Product Vision Statement
